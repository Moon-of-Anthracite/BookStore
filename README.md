#### Add Books & Edit Books
- The Add Books view is used to add books to the database one at a time. It redirects to Catalogue.
- Along with being used for adding new books to the database, the same layout is also used to edit books.

#### Favourites
- The Favourites view displays all the books that have been added to favourites from the Catalogue.
- It was achieved by defining a boolean property in the entity class and running a query to filter the same.
